# TODO: Fix Layout and Design for Login, Signup, Forgot Password, and Reset Password Forms

## Approved Plan
1. Improve button grouping and alignment across all forms (login, signup, forgot, reset) for better consistency and mobile responsiveness.
2. Adjust spacing and margins for cleaner layout.
3. Ensure the card and form elements are properly centered and sized.
4. Fix any potential overflow or alignment issues in the password input containers.
5. Make minor tweaks to colors or shadows if needed for better visual hierarchy.

## Breakdown into Logical Steps
- [x] Step 1: Analyze current button layouts in all forms (login, signup, forgot-password, reset-password) in App.jsx and identify inconsistencies.
- [x] Step 2: Standardize button groups in App.css for consistency across forms (e.g., ensure "Create New Account" and "Back to Home" buttons are properly aligned in login form).
- [x] Step 3: Adjust spacing and margins in forms (e.g., reduce excessive margins, ensure consistent padding in .card.landing-card).
- [x] Step 4: Fix password input container alignment and prevent overflow (e.g., ensure toggle button doesn't overlap text).
- [x] Step 5: Improve mobile responsiveness for button groups and form elements (update media queries in App.css).
- [x] Step 6: Make minor tweaks to colors, shadows, or gradients for better visual hierarchy (e.g., adjust button hover effects or card borders).
- [x] Step 7: Test the changes by running the app and verifying layout on different screen sizes.
- [x] Step 8: Final review and cleanup of CSS for any redundant styles.
